<b>SomaticSeq: An ensemble approach to accurately detect somatic mutations</b>
* Detailed documentation is included in the package. It's located in [docs/Manual.pdf](docs/Manual.pdf "Documentation").
* Open-access publication in Genome Biology can be found [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0758-2 "SomaticSeq paper").
* Feel free to report issues and/or ask questions at the [Issues](../../issues "Issues") page.

<b>Dockers</b>
* We have created a docker repo for SomaticSeq: https://hub.docker.com/r/lethalfang/somaticseq/.
* Since v2.3.0, we have also included some run script generators for the dockerized somatic mutation callers that we have incorporated, 
for [single-thread jobs](utilities/dockered_pipelines/singleThread) (e.g., for targeted sequencing) and [multi-thread jobs](utilities/dockered_pipelines/multiThreads) (e.g., for whole genome sequencing). The documentation for those scripts are in Section 4 of the [User's Manual](docs/Manual.pdf "Documentation").
